# READ OPERATION
# Reopen file again to read
# Ideally the bahavior of the Create flag should be like this
# create  If file exists      If file doesn't exists
# True    No file should be   A new file should
#         created and         be created
#         old file should     
#         open
# False   A new file should  Error should
#         be created         be thrown

# So this test case check whether if that condition
# is handled or not
